## To-Do List App

Yes... I made *another* To-Do List app. Am I a little embarrassed? Absolutely.

Is it groundbreaking? Not really.

But it does exactly what I want, and thatâ€™s the point. I built this app for myself, and Iâ€™m making it public in case anyone else finds it useful.

### Goals:
- **Keyboard-only navigation** â€“ no mouse required.
- **Built-in Priority Matrix** (aka the Eisenhower Matrix if you wanna sound *fancy* âœ¨ and *smert* ðŸ§ )
- **Flexible structure** â€“ create standalone lists or grouped topics with sublists.
- **Stupid simple** â€“ minimal, clean, and intuitive.

Iâ€™m a big fan of to-do lists for managing daily life, and Iâ€™ve developed a very specific way I like organizing mine. So, rather than keep stitching things together with sticky notes and generic apps, I figured: why not build something I actually want to use?

This gave me a chance to get some solid web dev XP, and create a tool that fits *me*.

If you try it out, feel free to send feedback, suggestions, or even hate mail (its humbling AND builds character).
